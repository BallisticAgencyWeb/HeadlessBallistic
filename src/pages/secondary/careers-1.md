Creating a great company culture starts with finding the right people. We're always looking for someone with great character, a strong work ethic, is a culture fit, and has top-level skills. Once on the team, we value the processing of clarifying our mission, values, and roles in the organization. You're immediately empowered to take responsibility for your projects and tasks. We have checklists in place to help get you started and to use for quality control. We're here to help, not micromanage. We set ambitious goals, and through our shared effort, we build unity and trust forged by our successes. This combines with a laid back and fun atmosphere, complete with sit/stand desks, fitness equipment, and lots of coffee. We also have regular education opportunities and quarterly and annual reviews, making for a great culture of performance and personality.
