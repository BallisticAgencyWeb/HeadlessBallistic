"CRO" is an all-encompassing term for increasing your website's revenue through small, data-driven, incremental steps.

There is no singular tool for increasing your site's conversion rate, but there is a method. And it starts by choosing to make decisions based on data, not opinion, hunches, or articles.

The tools that we use to boost traffic, orders, and revenue change for each website that we optimize. Whether it's increasing traffic, improving search, boosting speed, or improving customer service, the method stays the same.

It is easily summed up in one phrase: "Prove it."
