SEO is a competitive business.

If you are an eCommerce business, you can easily name a few competitors off the top of your head that compete for the higher rank in Google.

How do you get an advantage?

Slowly, but surely.

Our strategy is simple: follow their instructions. Google, and other search engines make it very clear to their customers what they are looking for, and what the best practices are. Which is why our strategy is built around using the best platforms and software, and staying up to date with Google's algorithm changes.

A small change in the algorithm can be the change that boosts you from 10th position to 6th, which can mean a difference of millions in revenue.
