  and your store off of Volusion and on to BigCommerce in record time. We know
  you weren't expecting to leave Volusion so quickly so, now for a limited time,

Hey there, I'm Jason from Ballistic Agency with some big news in the eCommerce world. Long-time eCommerce host Volusion has reportedly filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy following [last year's data hack](https://www.zdnet.com/article/card-data-from-the-volusion-web-skimmer-incident-surfaces-on-the-dark-web/) that exposed over 239, 000 credit cards across 6,500 of their online stores. So, if you're looking to migrate away from Volusion to a new platform now is a great time to do it.\

2. BigCommerce is a feature-rich platform that comes with robust tools and functionalities to quickly set up and efficiently manage a highly optimized online store.\

4. BigCommerce has 24-7 tech support with a first call resolution rate over 90%, ensuring little to no store downtime.\
