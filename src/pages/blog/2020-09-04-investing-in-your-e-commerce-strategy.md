## Three areas that you need to invest in with your eCommerce strategy and three areas where you can cut some costs.



### Three things to invest in

Here are the three things that you need to invest in today and spend money on that will have a return on your investment.

### 1. Conversion Rate Optimization

Almost immediately number one is conversion rate optimization. What is that? That is basically just making sure that your customers that are on your website can find what they're looking for, make a purchasing decision, and go all the way through the checkout process without having any problems. We want to make that as easy and painless as possible.

### 2. Search Engine Optimization

Number two SEO, or search engine optimization. We don't do SEO until we've done CRO we want all of the money and time and effort that we spend on SEO to be worth it. Once we get those people onto the website they can easily go through checkout and we're getting the maximum conversion rate possible. So, SEO comes second and that is where we make your site more visible on search engines like Google. Most websites are seeing 60, 70, and even 80% of their website traffic coming from Google and other search engines. So, investing here is absolutely critical.

### 3. Email Marketing

Number three is email marketing. Believe it or not, email marketing is still huge in the e-commerce world. It's one of the most profitable ways to get your customers to come back and make another purchase. But it's so much more than just uploading a pretty picture to [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) and hitting send. It's more about relevance, sending the right email to the right people at the right time. Then there are other areas that you need to be thinking about like segmentation, deliverability, and personalization. Getting it right in those three areas is absolutely critical. If you don't know what those three things are, contact us today and we'll talk to you more about it.



## Three areas where you can cut expenses

Now let's move on to the three areas where you can cut expenses related to your eCommerce website.

### 1. Expensive Software Licensing Fees

Number one is expensive software licensing fees. [Magento](https://magento.com/) is great at convincing people to spend tens of thousands of dollars, or even hundreds of thousands of dollars just for the privilege of having access to their software. Most small and medium-sized businesses don't need to spend a lot of money on licensing fees for software.

### 2. Expensive Website Hosting

Number two expensive website hosting it goes hand in hand with number one. Magento requires very powerful servers and internet connections to keep your site running quickly and efficiently.

### 3. Maintenance Fees

Number three goes hand in hand with the other two, maintenance fees. With software like Magento, you're having to pay someone to manage and maintain or repair and patch the software that you've purchased. What you probably need is a SASS solution software as a service. With a SASS provider, you cut out a lot of the expense of using legacy eCommerce platforms like Magento and instead you pay a reasonable monthly fee that includes access to their software, hosting, maintenance, all the updates, and the 24 7 technicians that keep your site online and secure.

And there you have it. Hopefully, you now understand the importance of your eCommerce channel, where you're going to get the most bang for your buck, and where you can cut costs in the future.
